# Death to Cookies

You might be used to being laughed at for your hatred of cookies, but fear not, this talk will give you all the arguments you need for defeating your opponents when they once more start claiming that cookies are the greatest invention since animated gifs.

In this session we will be reminded why the cookies are our death sworn nemesis and get every cookie sympathizer back in line. We will see how there is no escaping from the threat that is a free roaming cookie and explore the utopia of a cookie free society.

To do this, we pretend to be one of the misguided cookie lovers and try to protect our website against increasingly more complex attacks, without giving up on using cookies. Until we inevitable reach the point were it's simply no longer possible to offer a fully secure application.

## Private Description

This talk is 100% Ruby free. It is about security in the web. It will explore how different attacks work, briefly dipping into the well know attacks and then getting to smarter attacks most websites tend to be vulnerable against.

All the scenarios will be presented as one continuos, over-dramatic story about protecting some web service against a whole range of attacks, all based on how basically every one is using cookies today (as in HTTP cookies, not the delicious bakery products).

I'll start with a simple web service anyone could have build, simple user management, used for sending private messages or something. To stress that this is important, I'll give the example of the US president using that system to give the command for missile launches. Then I'll introduce the evil hacker and explain how he tries to hack the service in order to launch a missile.

After every attack example I explain how the web service will protect against this attack. At first, these protections will seem reasonable, but the more sophisticated the attacks get, the harder it will be to protect against these attacks. Up until we reach the point where it is close to impossible to protect against these attacks and it should become clear that any new or yet undisclosed attack could once more rip our application apart.

I will end the talk with an alternative approach to session management, which will not rely on cookies.

## Why should we choose you?

Why shouldn't you choose me? Don't you like me? :(

But I'll give an entertaining and educational talk about cookies!

I swear I'll shave this time and not wear that ridiculous shirt. Though they actually gave me the Ruby Hero Award wearing that shirt, that ought to say something, no?

I also know a lot about the topic, as I know HTTP (the protocol the web is based on) in and out and had to fight most of these attacks. I also moved a high traffic web service to a cookie-less architecture recently.
