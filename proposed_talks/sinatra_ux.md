# Breathing Life into Websites

In this talk we will explore how to turn a web design into a proper web application. We start of with a bit of HTML, CSS and JavaScript and will walk through adding server-side logic until we and up with a working application. In the process, we will see how the backend of a web app works and learn some Ruby and Sinatra.
